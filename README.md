# Accelerating-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-with-CUDA
This implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been accelerated using CUDA, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional CPU-based implementations. The CUDA platform allows for parallel processing on the GPU, which can significantly speed up the training and inference process for neural networks.
